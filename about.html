      <p>The main Idea behind to develop this website is to share the knowledge I have, and one other point is to preserve the knowledge,
      in written and digital format there are high number of chances that even one day I will be reffering my own post while designing something new :)
      </p>
       Currently I am exploring the field of Data science, machine learning and blockchain by myself, and looking for new opprtunities if you think I will be a good fit for something you know, please do let me know.

      <p>
      Okay, enough serious talk, :) I like movies, music and travelling, and always open to meet nice and interesting people of any field, so if you are planning a trip to somewhere, and open to include a new member give me a shout, most probably I will be joining you for a new adventure :)
